Assignment 2- Store Cart

Short Description
-Our project consists of three main views; a browse view, a cart view, and an order summary. A fresh browse view shows the user all 12 of the products that are sold in our store.
-A search bar exists in the top left, which allows you to filter products by name. It is case insensitive. Users can add and remove products from their cart using the "add" and "remove" buttons in each product card.
-Clicking the checkout view brings you to the cart view, the return button in the top left brings you back to the product view if you forgot something.
-The cart view lists all the items in your cart, with prices and quantities. Tax and order total is calculated and displayed. At the bottom is an order form to enter payment info and shipping address. Form validation exists to ensure valid input.
-If your input is valid, you can click the bottom button to confirm your order. This will bring you to the confirmation screen. This screen contains all order info, including your whole cart and entered payment info. Credit card info is redacted.
-Clicking the continue shopping button brings you to a fresh browse view with no items in your cart.
